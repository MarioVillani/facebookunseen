Facebook Unseen Plugin 1.1.7.2 - Cleaned version

This Chrome Extention is really useful. I unpacked it and noticed that tracks some actions.
I cleaned the source removing all trackings and what was not useful.

To Install :

1) Download the ZIP file. <br />
2) Unpack the zip file in a folder and remove the file LICENCE and README.MD  <br />
3) Open Chrome > Tools > Extensions  <br />
4) If not enable, enable Developer flag on top of the window  <br />
5) Click "Create Extension Package"  <br />
6) Select the folder where you unzipped the file, leave the Private Key field blank.  <br />
7) After the creation of the .crx file, drag it in Chrome Extentions Window and install.  <br />
8) Enjoy :)  <br />
