Facebook Unseen Plugin 1.1.7.2 - Cleaned version

This Chrome Extention is really useful. I unpacked it and noticed that tracks some actions.
I cleaned the source removing all trackings and what was not useful.

To Install :

1) Download the ZIP file. 
2) Unpack the zip file in a folder and remove the file LICENCE and README.ME
3) Open Chrome > Tools > Extensions
4) If not enable, enable Developer flag on top of the window
5) Click "Create Extension Package"
6) Select the folder where you unzipped the file, leave the Private Key field blank.
7) After the creation of the .crx file, drag it in Chrome Extentions Window and install.
8) Enjoy :)
